### A-Level Rank Points Calculator
A-Level Rank Points Calculator is a webapp that asks users to key in their A-Level Grades which then returns their rank points. Front-end is created with HTML and styled it with CSS. As for the back-end, it runs on Flask and Python. I am currently working on adding options to ask users for their subject combinations in JC and Secondary School which then returns a list of courses they are eligible for in NUS, NTU and SMU.

### Automated Typewriter Bot
To explore automation, I had created a typeracing bot using Python with selenium and pyautogui that automatically opens up a web browser, goes to TypeRacer.com and types the paragraph that needs to be typed out at high speeds. I have made it for multiplayer races as well where the user has to key in the string "go" in the python terminal when the race is about to start.

### Login System
To understand more about databases, I created a simple login system website where users can create an account by asking for their names, emails and asks them to create a password. Then they can sign in into their account. This is done by data being stored on a database where data is created when a new account is created and data is retrieved when a user with an existing account logs in. Currently working on changing database from a CSV file to a SQL database.

### Guess the Secret Number Game
A game that asks the player to guess a secret randomly generated number. Coded using Python.
