### SG University Course Tracker
https://sgunicoursetracker.onrender.com

SG University Course Tracker is a webapp that asks users to key in their A-Level Grades which then returns their rank points and the courses they are eligible for in NUS, NTU and SMU. Front-end is created with HTML, CSS and a bit of Javascript. As for the back-end, I used Flask framework coding with Python. The webapp is deployed through Render.

### POS Invoice Cost Convertor
I created this program to help my father's business. He usually imports goods from Malaysia for his shop in Singapore. However, the cost of each product is in malaysian currency in the invoice sent by the supplier. My father used to individually convert the cost to singapore currency and upload each item into the database in his POS account. To tackle this, I made this Python script whereby it filters the product name, it's barcode number and it's cost from the invoice, converts each product's cost into SGD and uploads all of this data into the template excel sheet neatly. Then, my father would only have to upload that excel sheet into his POS and all the entries for his products would be automatically updated in the database. This Python script aided my father greatly and he uses it regularly in his business now.

### Automated Typewriter Bot
To explore automation, I had created a typeracing bot using Python with selenium and pyautogui that automatically opens up a web browser, goes to TypeRacer.com and types the paragraph that needs to be typed out at high speeds. I have made it for multiplayer races as well where the user has to key in the string "go" in the python terminal when the race is about to start.

### Login System
To understand more about databases, I created a simple login system website where users can create an account by asking for their names, emails and asks them to create a password. Then they can sign in into their account. This is done by data being stored on a database where data is created when a new account is created and data is retrieved when a user with an existing account logs in.

Disclaimer: The front-end of the index.html file is a free template taken from an online source with a few minor changes I had made to suit this project. Only the back-end and the other html files were developed by me.

### Guess the Secret Number Game
A game that asks the player to guess a secret randomly generated number. Coded using Python.
